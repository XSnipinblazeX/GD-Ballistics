# GD-Ballistics

Community Open source advanced Ballistic solution for Godot engine



Works in Progress

currently simulates:
     External Ballistics
          Gravity
          Linear Drag
          Rotational Drag
          Magnus Effect
          cylindrical/capsule projectiles

To do:

Fix Hit Detection 
More advanced external ballistics?
     Temperature ?
     Wind?
     Coriolis?
     More Advanced Air Calculations?
Bring heavy calculations into a preloaded graph per projectile (is that even possible in godot?)
