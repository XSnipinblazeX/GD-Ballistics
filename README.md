# GD-Ballistics

Community Open source advanced Ballistic solution for Godot engine



Works in Progress

currently simulates:
     External Ballistics
          Gravity
          Linear Drag
          Rotational Drag
          Magnus Effect

Fix Hit Detection # Fixed 7/31/24
More advanced external ballistics?
     Temperature ?
     Wind?
     Coriolis?
     More Advanced Air Calculations?
Bring heavy calculations into a preloaded graph per projectile (is that even possible in godot?) # yes fixed 7/30/24
