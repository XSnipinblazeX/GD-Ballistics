Got basic trajectory down in godot.

Magnus effect is simulated with rpm on the axis. Closely represents reference data and visual 

Only problems so far is anything beyond 50m/s is hard to see on mobile. I will work on a debug line or some slow mo.

Next up on the to do for external ballistics:

Physically accurate linear drag (angular is working)
Get high velocity projectiles to work
Hit Detection
Wind
Environment Effects
      Temperature 
      Air Density and pressure
       Humidity
