# This is a very basic Ballistic trajectory with a *not* working hit detection
# Simulates gravity, drag, and the magnus effect
# This is all I deem necessary for a realistic trajectory for all types of projectiles.
# Magnus effect simulates magnus and possibly spin drift, haven't seen it yet since I'm making this on Godot mobile
# About 4/5 accurate when compared to my references using the F5 Sports Pitchlogic System
# Updated 7/28/2024
